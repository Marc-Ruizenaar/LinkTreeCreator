## Social linktree project
As a fun solo project, I decided to build a Linktree-like SaaS platform. I intentionally chose a competitive SaaS platform so I could look the competition and see how they designed/build there site.

## Built With:
Next.js
Supabase Auth
Supabase Database
Supabase Bucket
Tailwind css

## Roadmap

# Features to add
- Analytics page
- Sell products
- Pick different designs and add your colors, typography

# Minor improvements:
- Sections delete: Popup "Are you sure you want to delete this section?"
- Social media validation: At the moment you can enter everything you want
- Refactor: Create a button componant, popup componant, Heading componant, input componant for faster performance

## What I learned
- That I need to think more about refactoring
- Not leaving TS errors for later
- Better TS profiles makes it easier in the end
- Better understanding of useContext and useState within a useContext
- Supabase and all there basic features
