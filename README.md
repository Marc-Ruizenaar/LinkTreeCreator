## Social linktree project

As a fun solo project, I decided to build a Linktree-like SaaS platform. I intentionally chose a competitive SaaS platform so I could look the competition and see how they designed there site.

## Built With:

Next.js
Supabase Auth
Supabase Database
Supabase Bucket
Tailwind css

## Installation: 

1. Clone the Repo
2. rename the env.template to .env.local and add the keys
3. Install all dependencies
4. Run the site using:
```sh
npm run dev
```
5. Open browser and go to http://localhost:3000

## Roadmap

# Big imporvements:

- Analytics page

# Minor improvements:

- Sections delete: Popup "Are you sure you want to delete this section?"
- Social media validation: At the moment you can enter everything you want
- Refactor social media displaying. Every social media is at the moment a column, I would like to make this a array.
- My store page when there are no store's made. Add some premade templates or examples.
